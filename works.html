            <h1>How Republic Act 10630 Works?</h1>
            <br>
            <p><b>1. Apprehension and Investigation: </b> </p> 
                    <li>If a child below 15 years old is suspected of an offense, the law emphasizes 
                    immediate release to parents/guardians unless deemed necessary for their protection or investigation.</li>
                    <li>Social workers and police must prioritize diversionary measures like mediation, family counselling, and community services.</li>
                    <li>If an official investigation is necessary, it must be conducted with the child's best interests in mind, including access to 
                    legal counsel and protection from self-incrimination.</li> <br>

    <div class="importance2-text">
        <p><b>2. Diversion and Intervention: </b> </p> 
        <li>For children below 15, the courts prioritize diversion programs through the Local Social Welfare and Development Office (LSWDO) or accredited NGOs.</li>
        <li>These programs may involve counseling, education, community service, and restorative justice measures.</li>
        <li>Only in exceptional cases, if the child exhibits "discernment" and the offense is serious, may the court proceed with formal proceedings.</li> <br>

<p><b>3. Judicial Proceedings for Children 15-18 Years Old: </b></p>
        <li>For children aged 15-18, RA 10630 presumes they lack discernment, but this can be rebutted in court.</li>
        <li>If discernment is not proven, the court prioritizes diversion programs similar to those for younger children.</li>
        <li>If discernment is proven, or the offense is serious, the child may be subject to proceedings in special "Family Courts" 
            or, in some cases, regular courts with dedicated juvenile facilities.</li> <br>

<p><b>4. Detention and Rehabilitation:</b></p>
        <li>Detention for CICLs must always be a last resort and separate from adult offenders.</li>
        <li>Bahay Pag-asa facilities provide short-term residential care and rehabilitation programs 
            focused on education, skills training, and reintegration into society.</li>
        <li>Emphasis is placed on restorative justice and addressing the root causes of the child's behavior.</li> <br>

<p><b>5. Reintegration and Aftercare:</b></p>
        <li>After completing programs or serving sentences, CICLs receive support services to facilitate their reintegration into society.</li>
        <li>This may include education, employment assistance, and community support networks.</li>
