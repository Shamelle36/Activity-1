        <h2>Here are some of the features of Republic Act 10630:</h2>
        <br>
        <p><b>Raising the Minimum Age of Criminal Responsibility: </b> </p> 

            <li>Originally set at 9 years old under RA 9344, RA 10630 raised the minimum age of criminal responsibility (MCR) to 15 years old.</li>
            <li>This means children below 15 are exempt from criminal liability and cannot be prosecuted in court.</li> <br>
        
        <p><b>Focus on Rehabilitation and Diversion: </b></p> 
            
            <li>RA 10630 emphasizes restorative justice and rehabilitation for children in conflict with the law (CICLs).</li>
            <li>It expands diversion programs aimed at keeping CICLs out of the formal justice system and preventing criminalization.</li>
            <li>These programs may include counseling, community service, and education initiatives.</li> <br>
            
        <p><b>Improved Detention Conditions: </b> </p>
            
            <li>The Act establishes stricter guidelines for the detainment of CICLs, ensuring separation from adult offenders and prioritizing their welfare.</li>
            <li>It calls for child-friendly facilities with trained personnel and access to education, healthcare, and recreational activities. </li> <br>
        
        <p><b>Enhanced Rights and Due Process: </b> </p> 
            
            <li>RA 10630 strengthens safeguards for the rights of CICLs during judicial proceedings.</li>
            <li>This includes access to legal counsel, interpretation services, and protection from self-incrimination. </li> <br>
            
        <p><b>Community Involvement: </b> </p>
            
            <li>The Act encourages community involvement in supporting CICLs and their families. </li>
            <li>This includes establishing Bahay Pag-asa facilities for short-term residential care and promoting reintegration programs. </li> <br>
            
        <p><b>Criticisms and Ongoing Debates: </b></p>
            
            <li>While RA 10630 received praise for raising the MCR and prioritizing rehabilitation, some argue it doesn't go far enough. </li>
            <li>Concerns remain about overloaded diversion programs, the effectiveness of rehabilitation efforts, and potential loopholes in the raised MCR.</li>
